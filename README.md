## INTRODUCTION
MSc Advanced Computer Science course unit assessment for Object Oriented Programming (Java).

## AIM

The aim of this assignment is to develop a web-based wholesale stock control and ordering
system for food products. The system will allow a product’s details (description, category, price,
etc.) to be added and removed from an SQLite DB. The system will also have a list of business
customers with the business names and addresses stored for each customer. An order will have a
single customer from the customer list and list of products being ordered. The system will be
able to calculate the total price of an order when displaying that order’s summary. Advanced
versions of the system should be able to record the amount of stock being held of each product,
update stock levels as orders are created and deleted, and identify food items that have past
their expiry date.
